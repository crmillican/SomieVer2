# SOMIE iOS Apps Development Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the development strategy for the SOMIE iOS applications. Our goal is to provide native mobile experiences that complement the web platform while taking advantage of iOS-specific capabilities.

## Two-App Approach

We've decided to create two separate applications:

1. **SOMIE Business** - For businesses to manage their collaborations
2. **SOMIE Creator** - For influencers to discover and fulfill opportunities

The rationale for this separation:
- Different user needs and workflows
- Focused UX for each audience
- Different feature sets (analytics for businesses, content creation for influencers)
- Smaller app size and better performance

## Technology Stack

- **Swift + SwiftUI** - Modern UI framework with native performance
- **UIKit** - For more complex UI components not available in SwiftUI
- **Combine** - For reactive programming and data binding
- **Core Data** - For persistent local storage and offline support
- **URLSession** - For networking and API communication

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- ✅ Create app structures and architecture
- ✅ Define data models that mirror backend schemas
- ✅ Implement authentication and session management
- ✅ Build core managers for API communication 

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- ⬜ Implement main screens and navigation
- ⬜ Build discovery and listing views
- ⬜ Develop messaging functionality
- ⬜ Create profile management
- ⬜ Implement offer/claim lifecycle

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- ⬜ Add push notifications
- ⬜ Integrate camera for content creation
- ⬜ Implement social sharing functionality
- ⬜ Add location-based discovery
- ⬜ Build analytics dashboards

### Phase 4: Polishing
- ⬜ Performance optimization
- ⬜ Accessibility improvements
- ⬜ Localization
- ⬜ Final UI/UX refinements

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Backend API <--> DataManager <--> SwiftUI Views
                    ↑
                    ↓
                Core Data
                    ↑
                    ↓
             Local Cache/Storage
```

### Authentication Flow
```
Login/Register UI → AuthManager → JWT Token Storage → Session Management
```

### Key Components

1. **Managers**
   - AuthManager: Handles user authentication and session management
   - DataManager: Manages API communication and data caching
   - NotificationManager: Handles push notifications (future)
   - LocationManager: Manages location services (future)

2. **Models**
   - Shared models that mirror backend schemas
   - Local Core Data entities for persistence

3. **Views**
   - Organized by feature/screen
   - Composed of reusable components

4. **Utilities**
   - Network layer abstractions
   - Date/string formatting helpers
   - Analytics tracking (future)
   - Error handling utilities

## Offline Support Strategy

1. **Data Persistence**
   - Cache frequently accessed data in Core Data
   - Store user-generated content locally before submission
   - Sync when connectivity is restored

2. **Queue-Based Operations**
   - Queue operations that require connectivity
   - Retry mechanism for failed network requests
   - Background fetch for periodic updates

## App Store Strategy

- Business app focused on subscription management and analytics
- Creator app emphasizing discovery and content creation
- Both apps will highlight the SOMIE brand identity
- App Store screenshots will showcase core workflows
- Targeted marketing descriptions for each audience

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for model logic and managers
- UI tests for critical user flows
- TestFlight beta testing with select users
- A/B testing for key conversion points

## Integration with Web Platform

- Shared authentication tokens
- Deep linking between platforms
- Consistent data models and business logic
- Web fallback for complex operations

## iOS-Specific Advantages

- **Push Notifications** for immediate engagement
- **Camera Integration** for streamlined content creation
- **Location Services** for geo-targeted offers
- **Face ID/Touch ID** for secure authentication
- **Shortcuts** for quick actions
- **Widgets** for glanceable information
